                        Entry to the event is completely free! The amount of money you should bring is dependent on
                        what, if anything, you wish to purchase at the festival. If you are driving, there is a $5
                        charge to park at the parking garage (You can find more parking information here ). If you
                        plan
                        to eat at the festival, you may also wish to bring at least $10. Prices of the various baked
                        goods, produce, and crafts vary by vendor. Many of our vendors and their items can be found
                        here.

                        Most of our vendors accept credit cards, however, you should bring some cash in case a shop

                        Bringing a dog is strongly discouraged due to pets not being allowed on the Commons.
                        Additionally, the event will be crowded and may be overwhelming for your furry friend, or it
                        may
                        be difficult to move through the crowds. Registered service animals are permitted.

                        If you are looking to avoid the crowds, attending midday Friday is a good idea. However,
                        many
                        attendees find that the crowds on the weekend add to the energy and fun of the festival.
