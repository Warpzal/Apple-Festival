        <h2 class="py-5 pb-3">Things To Do</h2>
        <p class="pb-5">
            From hiking to going to a vineyard, Ithaca is full of activities that you and your family can explore during
            your visit. If you are staying a few days, or if you have some extra time after attending the Apple Harvest
            Festival, here are some things you can do in the Ithaca area.
        </p>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="hiking local-shopping">
                <h2>Hiking</h2>
                <p>
                    Taughannock Falls State Park, Buttermilk Falls State Park, and Treman State Park, are all full of
                    waterfalls, gorges, and beautiful views that you can explore through winding trails. There are many
                    trails, ranging in distances and difficulty. These parks are all within a 20-minute drive of the
                    Ithaca
                    Commons.

                    Cornell University has a beautiful campus bustling with students in the fall. The views from the
                    slope
                    are gorge-ous as the leaves change, and Beebe lake near north campus is a beautiful, short walk. The
                    Cornell Botanical Gardens also feature beautiful flowers and foliage to stroll through.
                </p>
                <h2>More Local Shopping</h2>
                <p>
                    The Farmers Market is a staple of the Ithaca community. Similar to the Harvest Festival, many local
                    vendors and creators come together to provide their creations to the Ithaca community. Many people
                    come from the surrounding area to visit this market, and you can buy almost anything you want! The
                    best part is they are open almost year round (except for those awfully cold winter months), so you
                    can come back anytime to check it out.
                </p>
                <h2>Dining</h2>
                <p>
                    Be sure to dine at some of Ithaca's most popular restaurants, like the Ithaca Beer Company, Asia
                    Cuisine, Taste of Thai, Red's Place, Bickering Twins, Hawi, and many many more! Most of these
                    restaurants can be found in the Commons, so they are perfect for dinner after attending the Harvest
                    Festival!
                </p>

            <div class="vineyard">
                <h2>Vineyard</h2>
                <div id="vineyard" class="img-container">
                    <img src="./images/apple-wines.jpg" alt="apple wines">
                </div>
                <p class="pt-2">
                    If the cider and wine vendors at the festival weren't enough to immerse yourself in the Finger Lakes
                    wine and cider scene, check out Six Mile Creek, a small winery only 10 minutes away from the
                    Commons.
                    With a tasting room and plenty of outdoor seating, the vineyard offers a taste of Ithaca wine, as
                    well
                    as beers and cheeses. Don't worry, if your party includes people under the age of 21, they sell
                    non-alcoholic drinks too!
